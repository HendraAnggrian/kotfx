<p>A series of width or sets of four width values, separated by commas.
For each item in the series, a single width value means that all border widths are the same; and if a set of four
width values is specified, they are used for the top, right, bottom, and left border widths, in that order.
If the border is not rectangular, only the first width value is used. Each item in the series of widths applies
to the corresponding item in the series of border images.
Percentage values may be used here, in which case the values are considered proportional to the border image area.</p>
